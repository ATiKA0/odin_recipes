    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Some recipes for chicken paprikash include vegetables like bell peppers and celery, but not my Grandmother Alta’s. Hers was a simple combination of chicken, onions, garlic, paprika and sour cream. —Lily Julow, Lawrenceville, Georgia</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 broiler/fryer chickens (about 3-1/2 to 4 pounds each), cut into 8 pieces each</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons peanut oil or canola oil</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, halved and sliced</li>
        <li>2 large garlic cloves, chopped</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sweet Hungarian paprika</li>
        <li>2 cups hot chicken broth or water</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>Optional: Minced fresh parsley and additional sweet Hungarian paprika</li>
        <li>Hot cooked noodles or mashed potatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken with kosher salt and pepper. In a Dutch oven, heat peanut oil over medium-high heat. Brown chicken in batches. Remove with a slotted spoon; drain and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low. Add onions; cook, stirring to loosen browned bits from pan, until onions begin to soften, 6-8 minutes. Add garlic; cook 1 minute longer.</li>
        <li>Stir in flour and paprika; reduce heat to low. Cook until paprika is fragrant, 3-5 minutes. Add broth; cook, stirring constantly, until smooth, 6-8 minutes. Return chicken to pan; simmer, covered, until a thermometer inserted into deepest part of thigh reads 170°, about 30 minutes. Transfer chicken to a serving platter.</li>
        <li>Skim fat. Stir in sour cream; heat just until warmed through, 3-5 minutes (do not allow to boil). If desired, sprinkle with parsley and additional paprika. Serve with hot cooked noodles or mashed potatoes.</li>
    </ol>
